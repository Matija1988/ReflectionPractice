This sample project is an upgrade from Coding Tutorials - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5spUmVMkVU - tutorial on .NET reflections. 

This tutorial has been further upgraded not to only show a single object in CSV but 1:1 and 1:M relationships. 

Example 1:1 relationship

Reflections in .NET are a powerful tool able to collect metadata of objects during runtime. 
With reflection we can get all properties, methods, constructors of an object, their information, values and attributes. Reflection can also be used to get information about Interfaces, table names, table properties etc. so along with this example reflection can be used to automatically create SQL queries in abstract repositories, create tools or messaging systems between modules (MassTransit for example).
